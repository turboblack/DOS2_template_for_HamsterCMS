DOS2 template for HamsterCMS without Bootstrap (386) simple clean code

HTML template with a design similar to DOS programs from Symantec

https://github.com/turboblack/HamsterCMS world's smallest and very simple multi-template flatfile content management system 

this template is special in that it does not have any graphics, it is made exclusively of text symbols

HTML template made in the form of MS DOS programs

Great for an old school project

To use a template, create an **dos2** folder in the **templates** folder, copy **index.html** there, open the admin panel on the hosting, select the page, and specify this template in the options.
